## Highlights
- Designed a bridge and tested its structural integrity using SolidWorks (CAD) and its Finite Element Analysis (FEA) feature
- Fabricated the bridge using a laser-cutter, and stress-tested the bridge


## Overview
My sophomore year, as a final project we were tasked with building a bridge for a final project. They were scored based off of
the strength to weight ratio. We began by studying existing bridges, and using their features as inspiration, designed bridges 
of our own. After modeling our bridges in SolidWorks, we utilized the finite element analysis feature to test our bridges. 
In my group of three, my bridge performed the best. As a result, we used it for the final class competition. We laser cut 
my design and built it for the competition.
