## Highlights
- Designed a gripping mechanism to pick up microplates from a drone within a 5mm sphere of uncertainty
- Designed a test stand to simulate drone flight in order to test our gipping mechanism
- Created custom parts in SolidWorks(CAD), manufactured parts by hand, and tested and improved upon failures
- Presented progress of our gripping mechanism to a board of advisors and our sponsoring company

## Overview
For my senior capstone design course, I was part of a group of five engineers tasked with designing a gripping mechanism to attach to a drone. This gripping mechanism would then acquire and deposit microplates in High Throughput Screening for drug testing. Currently Robotic arms mounted on the ground are used, but the NIH wants to switch to a drone-based system. The drone is a much less precise mechanical system only being able to position itself within 5mm of its desired location. The gripper had to be designed to correct this positional uncertainty. We had three mechanical engineers in our group, each focusing on a different part of the design.

## My Work
My focus was on guide rails to bring the microplate into a fixed position once it had been acquired. I realized that we could utilize a lip that protruded from the microplate to control its position. I went through many different iterations to allow for a full range of acquisition of the microplate, maintain it in transport, and then deposit it reliably. In the first designs, the microplate would fall through the bottom, or turn on contact. By increasing the width of the base and fixing some curves, I was able to solve these problems. 
I also designed all of the mechanical tests we ran to test our specifications. We needed to test for positional variability in acquisition, and for the gripping mechanismâ€™s ability to retain the microplate during 1G acceleration. I realized we could attach a camera mount capable of pitch, roll, and yaw to a platform, which could translate in the x, y, and z directions. We built a test rig and marked off positions which would create a 5mm bounding box that our gripping mechanism was required to work within. For our acceleration testing, the group first planned on linearly accelerating the gripping mechanism at 1G. I realized that it would be much easier for us to rotate the gripping mechanism at the end of an arm at a constant angular velocity giving us 1G of acceleration in the radial direction.
