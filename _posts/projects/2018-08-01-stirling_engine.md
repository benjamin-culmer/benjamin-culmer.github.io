## Highlights
- Machined, built, and optimized a Stirling Engine by hand
- Acquired experience with 2-D lathing, 3-D milling, and brazing


## Overview
Over my Sophomore Summer, along with my digital electronics course, I took a course in thermodynamics. 
To add a hands-on portion to the class, we built Stirling Engines. We were given unfinished parts, and
finished building them in the machine shop. This included using a 2-D lathe to turn down shafts and make wheels,
3-D milling to make the base and other plates, and finally brazing together different parts. In the end,
our engines competed to find their efficiency and tolerances.
