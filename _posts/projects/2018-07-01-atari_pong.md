## Highlights
- Designed a circuit for Atari Pong, and coded the game in a digital hardware language (VHDL) 
- Donated the game on a field-programmable gate array, per his request, to the professor to display to prospective students


## Overview
Sophomore Summer is a Dartmouth tradition where all Sophomores stay on over the summer term to take classes. 
This was especially fun as that is the main time for football training making time management essential. 
During this term, I took a class in digital electronics, where for a final project, we were tasked with 
programing a game onto an FPGA in VHDL. To add to the diversity of the projects, each had to have a characteristic
added outside of the basic program. My partner and I decided to program Atari Pong. I designed out state diagram, 
helped write the code for the game, and troubleshot issues using VHDL's testbench. To differentiate our game from others,
we had a switch to set our professors face as the background, and a second that would invert all colors. 
After the final presentation of all games, our professor asked if he could keep ours as a demo for future prospective students.
