## Highlights
- Researched alternative methods and materials to use in an artificial kidney system and performed a cost-benefit analysis
- Created 3D models of kidney systems from CT scans using Mimics software
- Built parts of the artificial kidney system and wrote a repeatable procedure for building future parts. 


## Overview
In the spring of 2019, I went back to Dartmouth for class. My advisor informed me that a PhD candidate was in need of a research assistant. I was tasked with creating an artificial kidney system to be used in his research. They needed a system that was both reusable, cost efficient, and displayed different contrasts for different parts of the system.

## My Work
After I researched different options for this system, I concluded that the cheapest solution was to create a silicone mold of each part of the kidney system based off of a 3D model I had created. I used Mimics and the cancer patientsâ€™ CT scans to create a 3D model of the different parts of the kidney system. Using this 3D model, I 3D-printed the kidney, and used it to create a mold for the part. I planned to repeat this process for all the other parts of the system. Once I knew how to make the organs, I needed to figure out a way to have them show different contrast in the scans. I decided each part would receive a different concentration of contrast agent to achieve a different contrast in the scan. To test this approach and save materials, I molded acorn nuts to test in the scanner. Finally, I created documentation of all of my progress to hand over to the PhD candidate, which he then gave to his next research assistant.
