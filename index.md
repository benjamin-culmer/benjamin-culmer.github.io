Hello World

My name is Ben Culmer. I was born and raised in Northern Virginia. Since a young age, I have been fascinated by how mechanical parts function. 
I brought this interest to college and became a mechanical engineer. Through this process, I learned that I love designing parts that meet rigid specifications and then getting my hands dirty by building my design. 
I will graduate in June of 2020 with both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Engineering from Dartmouth College which I accomplished while playing football and finishing my senior season as Ivy League Champions.

Throughout my time as an aspiring engineer, I have been given three pieces of advice that I take to heart and let guide me through my work: establish a reputation, be simplistic, and test often. 
The first was from a career engineer who told me to establish and maintain a reputation for doing quality work in a safe manner. This is my goal in all of my work. 
While it is hard to display this in college, as our projects are controlled and on a small scale, I always keep it in mind and will continue to focus on it while working as an engineer. 
The second was from my mentor, who said as an engineer it is important to create elegant, simplistic, yet highly functional solutions. I believe this is what separates me from my peers.
My solutions to issues are always simplistic yet very functional. I will get into examples later. Finally, I was told to fail fast and fail often. 
I believe that throughout the engineering process, you will often run into issues you did not expect. Rather than be hit with every issue all at once, it is better to space them out and solve them one at a time.
