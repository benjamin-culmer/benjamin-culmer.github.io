## Football
I grew up playing sports, with my main sport being lacrosse. I didn’t start playing football until my freshman year of high school. In my junior year, I realized I was a lot better at football than lacrosse so I decided I would try to play football instead of lacrosse in college. I ended up committing to Dartmouth College my senior year. I played football all four years at Dartmouth, completing my eligibility this past fall and winning the Ivy League Championship. Playing football in college taught me about maturity and leadership, as well as giving me some of my fondest memories. Two of these memories are playing at Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium. What I remember and miss most, though, is preseason training. Those few weeks were always the most enjoyable, training and pushing ourselves to the max with no distractions. We worked hard but we were rewarded with fun team activities. My favorite was “Beach Day,” where we would all go to a nearby lake together. 

I also loved and will miss the challenges that playing football as a student athlete brought. I learned to appreciate structuring my life around what was important to me: school and football. Focusing on these priorities greatly increased my enjoyment from success in both areas. After the season ended my priorities paid off as I was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame's National Football Foundation Hampshire Honor Society for my academic success while simultaniously significantly contributing to my team.

## Free Time
Some of my passions include: nature, music, and cars. Before college, I spent a lot of my time in the woods biking and fishing as there was a county forest next to our backyard. After I graduate from college, I hope to continue these activities as well as start camping.

I am also passionate about music. I love listening to music and admire the complexities in songs. Growing up, I played the cello, and taught myself the electric bass during high school. I continue to play the bass and love to play classic rock.

Finally, I love cars and watching Formula 1. After I graduate from college, I plan to work on my own car and drive at race tracks.
