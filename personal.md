## Football
I didn’t start playing football until my freshman year of high school. My main sport had always been lacrosse when I was growing up. My junior year of high school, I realized I was a lot better at football, so I switched sports. I ended up committing to Dartmouth College, which was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I played football all four years at Dartmouth, completing my eligibility this past fall and wining the Ivy League Championship. Football has structured my life both in and out of season and given me some of my fondest memories. Two of these memories are playing at Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium. What I remember and miss most, though, will be preseason training. Those few weeks were always the most enjoyable, training and pushing ourselves to the max with no distractions. We worked hard but we were although rewarded with fun team activities. My favorite being “Beach Day” where we would all go to a nearby lake together. 

I also loved and will miss the challenges that playing football as a student athlete brought. I always found it extremely satisfying going directly from class to practice then to the library to do homework. I loved the pressure that it brought and doing well was significantly more rewarding both on and off the field.

## Free Time
Some of my passions include: nature, music, and cars. I see myself as an outdoorsman; While growing up, I spent a majority of my time out in the woods biking and fishing. I plan on continuing these activities as well as adding camping to the list. I am also passionate about music. I love listening to music and admire the complexities in songs. I grew up playing the cello, but taught myself the electric bass during high school. I continue to play the bass and love to play classic rock. Finally, I love cars. Once I am out of college, I plan on working on my own cars and driving on race tracks.
