## Football
I grew up playing sports, with my main sport being lacrosse. I didn’t start playing football until my freshman year of high school. My junior year of high school, I realized I was a lot better at football than lacrosse, so I decided I would try to play football instead of lacrosse in college. I ended up committing to Dartmouth College my senior year. I played football all four years at Dartmouth, completing my eligibility this past fall and wining the Ivy League Championship. Playing football in college taught me a lot about maturity and leadership as well as giving me some of my fondest memories. Two of these memories are playing at Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium. What I remember and miss most, though, will be preseason training. Those few weeks were always the most enjoyable, training and pushing ourselves to the max with no distractions. We worked hard but we were although rewarded with fun team activities. My favorite being “Beach Day” where we would all go to a nearby lake together. 

I also loved and will miss the challenges that playing football as a student athlete brought. I learned to appreciate structuring my life around what was important to me: school and football. Focusing on these priorities greatly increased my enjoyment from success in both areas.

## Free Time
Some of my passions include: nature, music, and cars. Growing up, I spent a majority of my time out in the woods biking and fishing as there was a state forest neighboring our backyard. After I graduate college, I hope to continue these activities as well as start camping.

I am also passionate about music. I love listening to music and admire the complexities in songs. Growing up, I played the cello, but taught myself the electric bass during high school. I continue to play the bass and love to play classic rock.

Finally, I love cars and watching Formula 1. After I graduate college, I plan on working on my own car and driving on race tracks.
